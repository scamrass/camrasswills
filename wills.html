					<h3>The Intestacy Laws - what happens if you die without a valid Will.</h3>

					<p>Without a Will, your estate will be divided according to
						the UK's Intestacy Laws. In effect, the Government
						writes a Will for you.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to the money, think about who would look
						after your children if both parents die and the kids are
						under 18. Without a Will, the state will decide. Often
						the Grandparents are keen to help which is great but it
						can lead to a dispute which could end up in court
						meanwhile the kids might end up in foster homes!
					</p>
					<p>
						You need to decide who is best placed and willing to
						look after your children after such a traumatic event
						and the only way to ensure it happens is to say so in a
						Will.

					<h3>Single Will</h3>
					<p>A single Will is appropriate for you if you just want to
						make a Will for yourself. This can apply even if you are
						married, in a cilvil partnership, in a partnership,
						divorced or widowed. If you are not single or you have
						children, it may be appropriate to consider other types
						of wills.</p>

					<a name="Mirror Wills"></a>
					<h3>Mirror Wills</h3>
					<p> A pair of Mirror Wills is appropriate when you and your
						partner or spouse wish to write similar Wills. If you
						make a pair of Mirror Wills, you will receive two Wills
						(one for you, one for your
						spouse or partner). You can make a pair of Mirror Wills
						if all of the following are true:-</p>
					<ul class="arrowed1">
						<li>You want to leave your Residuary Estate to each
							other as the primary beneficiary</li>
						<li>You have identical beneficiaries for your Residuary
							Estate</li>
						<li>You both have the same Last Wishes or have specified
							them in separate letters.</li>

					</ul>

						<h3>Trust Wills</h3>
						<p>For many people just having a Will is not enough, you
							need to make sure it"s the right Will. Given the
							choice, all of us would choose to have our affairs
							in order and be certain that assets are passed down
							in accordance with our wishes. Most of us want to
							ensure that children and other beneficiaries inherit
							our wealth but all too often we fail to choose the
							best and most effective estate planning strategy.
							Unless your Will incorporates speciﬁc trusts you are
							running a significant risk of family wealth being
							eroded and falling into the hands of unintended
							beneﬁciaries. Some instances when this may occur
							include:-</p>
						<ul class="arrowed1">
							<li>Increasing a beneficiares Inheritance Tax
								liability</li>
							<li>Divorce following an inheritance and the amount
								being included in the settlement</li>
							<li>The suing of a beneficiary meaning the
								inheritance is included in the compensation
								assessment.</li>
							<li>A surviving spouse remarries and subsequently
								divorces resulting in a reduction of family
								wealth to be passed on to your children</li>
							<li>Long term care costs eroding or using up all
								your assets including your home</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p><a href="tenantsincommon.html"> For a Trust Will to
								be effective, property needs to be owned as
								Tenants in Common.</a></p>
