					<h3>What happens if you die without making a Will?</h3>

					<p> Making a Will is relatively straightforward and not very
						expensive. Despite this, almost seven out of ten people
						in the UK die without a Will. This often causes delays,
						hardship and worry - and even costly legal bills can
						result if there is confusion and disagreement among
						those left behind.

					</p>
					<p>Should you die without a Will or if your Will is deemed
						to be invalid (e.g. if it wasn"t completed or signed
						correctly) then you are said to have died intestate.
						This results in the laws of the land deciding how your
						estate is distributed. The distribution of your estate
						is determined by your marital situation at the time of
						your death. </p>
					<p>The following notes are meant for guidance only, and
						please note that the laws relating to Scotland and
						Northern Ireland differ in some aspects.</p>
					<p>
						Married with children (separated people are treated
						under these rules as still being married) :-<br>
						1) Your spouse gets:<br>
						a) personal chattels (e.g. car, house contents,
						jewellery etc). plus <br>
						b) first £250,000 of your estate, plus<br>
						c) the income on half of any surplus (only income, your
						spouse cannot touch the capital)<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						2) Your children (stepchildren get nothing) get:<br>
						a) half of any excess over £250,000 outright, plus<br>
						b) the other half of the excess when your spouse has
						also died<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Married with no children but with parents and no
						brothers and sisters :-<br>
						1) Your spouse gets:<br>
						a) personal chattels (e.g. car, house contents,
						jewellery etc). plus<br>
						b) first £450,000 of your estate, plus<br>
						c) half of any excess over £450.000 outright<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						2) Your parents or (if none alive) your brothers and
						sisters get:<br>
						a) Balance i.e. half of any excess over £450,000
						outright<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Married with no children and no parents and no brothers
						and sisters :-<br>
						Your spouse gets everything<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Single, Widowed or Divorced (but not separated) :-<br>
						Everything goes to your children (if any), otherwise to
						your parents (if alive), otherwise to your brothers and
						sisters (or their children), otherwise your grandparents
						(if alive), otherwise your uncles and aunts (or their
						children), otherwise to the government.</p>

					<h3>Single Will</h3>
					<p>A single Will is appropriate for you if you just want to
						make a Will for yourself. This can apply even if you are
						married, in a cilvil partnership, in a partnership,
						divorced or widowed. If you are not single or you have
						children, it may be appropriate to consider other types
						of wills.</p>

					<a name="Mirror Wills"></a>
					<h3>Mirror Wills</h3>
					<p> A pair of Mirror Wills is appropriate when you and your
						partner or spouse wish to write similar Wills. If you
						make a pair of Mirror Wills, you will receive two Wills
						(one for you, one for your
						spouse or partner). You can make a pair of Mirror Wills
						if all of the following are true:-</p>
					<ul class="arrowed1">
						<li>You want to leave your Residuary Estate to each
							other as the primary beneficiary</li>
						<li>You have identical beneficiaries for your Residuary
							Estate</li>
						<li>You both have the same Last Wishes or have specified
							them in separate letters.</li>

					</ul>

						<h3>Trust Wills</h3>
						<p>For many people just having a Will is not enough, you
							need to make sure it"s the right Will. Given the
							choice, all of us would choose to have our affairs
							in order and be certain that assets are passed down
							in accordance with our wishes. Most of us want to
							ensure that children and other beneficiaries inherit
							our wealth but all too often we fail to choose the
							best and most effective estate planning strategy.
							Unless your Will incorporates speciﬁc trusts you are
							running a significant risk of family wealth being
							eroded and falling into the hands of unintended
							beneﬁciaries. Some instances when this may occur
							include:-</p>
						<ul class="arrowed1">
							<li>Increasing a beneficiares Inheritance Tax
								liability</li>
							<li>Divorce following an inheritance and the amount
								being included in the settlement</li>
							<li>The suing of a beneficiary meaning the
								inheritance is included in the compensation
								assessment.</li>
							<li>A surviving spouse remarries and subsequently
								divorces resulting in a reduction of family
								wealth to be passed on to your children</li>
							<li>Long term care costs eroding or using up all
								your assets including your home</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p><a href="tenantsincommon.html"> For a Trust Will to
								be effective, property needs to be owned as
								Tenants in Common.</a></p>
