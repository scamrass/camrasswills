          <h3>
            Who is Peter Camrass?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Peter has lived most of his life in Kent. After studying Economics
            at the University of Kent at Canterbury, he started his career in
            financial services: mainly working in technical pensions for
            Scottish Equitable and Clerical Medical. While his four children
            were growing up, he became very involved with the local Scouts and
            although he "retired" from being a scout leader in 2017, he is still
            helping with summer canoeing and acting as quartermaster for the
            group. Peter was a school governor for 11 years and has worked
            extensively with the teaching profession giving advice on pensions
            and investment. Peter also runs a small table tennis club in Yalding
            and is a qualified instructor. Peter is currently Chair of the Kent
            Region for the Society of Will Writers.

            Who is Lucy Camrass?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Lucy graduated from the University of Brighton with a first class
            honours degree in International Business. Having helped her father
            with the Camrass Wills business over the years, she decided after
            graduating to put both her degree and her knowledge of the family
            business into practice and set up her own branch of Camrass Wills.
            In her spare time Lucy also helps out with Scouts and is a keen
            surfer. She has already surfed in France, Spain, Portugal, Morocco
            and India as well as various locations in the UK.
