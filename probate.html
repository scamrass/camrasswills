					<h3>Probate</h3>
					<p>Probate is the legal process that takes place after a
						death. It can be a lengthy and complicated process but
						it doesn't have to be expensive. You do not have to use
						the bank or solicitor who drew up the Will - they often
						charge much more than you need to pay.</p>
					<p>For Estates where there is no tax to pay, the Government
						have introduced an online process that allows many
						people to apply for probate themselves.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate"
							target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate</a>
					</p>
					<p>Probate establishes ownership of an estate before the tax
						is paid (if any is due) and the assets distributed. The
						responsibility for probate lies with the executors of a
						will who often appoint a professional firm, to take on
						the responsibility. Probate is still required where
						there is no will although the process is known as
						Administration.
					</p>
					<p>The executors have a number of responsibilities,
						including:-
					<ul class="unformattedBulletPoints">
						<li>Interpreting the will and ensuring that the wishes
							of the deceased as expressed in the will are carried
							out</li>
						<li>Identifying all the assets and liabilities of the
							estate</li>
						<li>Obtaining valuations of the joint and sole assets as
							at the time of death</li>
						<li>Ensuring that the estate of the deceased is handled
							efficiently and that the funds and assets in the
							estate including businesses, are properly managed
						</li>
						<li>Preparing tax returns for the deceased for
							Inheritance Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Income Tax and
							Stamp Duty Land Tax</li>
						<li>Settling all the debts of the estate including all
							taxes</li>
						<li>Completing and filing the relevant court forms</li>
						<li>Applying for Probate</li>
						<li>Preparing accounts for the beneficiaries and after
							payment of all claims, distributing the estate</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Our Probate service</h3>
					<p>We offer a fixed price probate service based on what you
						need help with and how complex it is. Where the estate
						is small enough not to need a formal process, we will
						tell you straight away and you will not have any fees to
						pay.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to the fee charged by us there may be
						disbursements such as:- </p>
					<ul class="unformattedBulletPoints">
						<li>Estate Agents fees</li>
						<li>Court fees</li>
						<li>Cost of advertising for creditors/claimants</li>
						<li>Cost of tracing missing beneficiaries</li>
						<li>The disbursements will be identified as far as
							possible and incorporated in the Administration
							Plan.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>All fees and disbursements are valid testamentary
						expenses payable by the estate.</p>

					<p>For very complex cases, we may refer you to a larger
						company who have additional resources.
