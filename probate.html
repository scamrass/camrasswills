					<h3>Probate</h3>
					<p>Probate is the legal process that takes place after a
						death. It can be a lengthy and complicated process but
						it doesn"t have to be expensive. You do not have to use
						the bank or solicitor who drew up the Will - they often
						charge much more than you need to pay.</p>
					<p>
						Probate establishes ownership of an estate before the
						tax is paid (if any is due) and the assets distributed.
						The responsibility for probate lies with the executors
						of a will who often appoint a professional firm, to take
						on the responsibility. Probate is still required where
						there is no will although the process is known as
						Administration.</p>
					<p>The executors have a number of responsibilities,
						including:</p>
					<p>-Interpreting the will and ensuring that the wishes of
						the deceased as expressed in the will are carried out
					</p>
					<p>-Identifying all the assets and liabilities of the estate
					</p>
					<p>-Obtaining valuations of the joint and sole assets as at
						the time of death</p>
					<p>-Ensuring that the estate of the deceased is handled
						efficiently and that the funds and assets in the estate
						including businesses, are properly managed </p>
					<p>-Preparing tax returns for the deceased for Inheritance
						Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Income Tax and Stamp Duty Land
						Tax</p>
					<p>-Settling all the debts of the estate including all taxes
					</p>
					<p>-Completing and filing the relevant court forms</p>
					<p>-Applying for Probate</p>
					<p>-Preparing accounts for the beneficiaries and after
						payment of all claims, distributing the estate</p>

					<p>Working with SWW Trust Corporation, we can handle all of
						these responsibilities and can support you with Probate,
						irrespective of who is named in the will as an executor
						and even where there is no will.</p>

					<h3>Our Probate service</h3>
					<p>We offer a fixed price probate service based on the value
						of the estate and how complex it is. Where the estate is
						small enough not to need a formal process, we will tell
						you straight away and you will not have any fees to pay.
					</p>
					<p>In addition to the fee charged by us there may be
						disbursements such as:- </p>
					<p>-Estate Agents fees </p>
					<p>-Tax Agents fees </p>
					<p>-Solicitors fees and disbursements</p>
					<p>-Court fees</p>
					<p>-Cost of advertising for creditors/claimants</p>
					<p>-Cost of tracing missing beneficiaries</p>
					<p>-The disbursements will be identified as far as possible
						and incorporated in the Administration Plan.</p>
					<p>All fees and disbursements are valid testamentary
						expenses payable by the estate.</p>

					<p>We work exclusively with the Society of Will Writers
						Trust Corporation (Probate &amp; Trustee Services Ltd)
						who are a national company specialising in Probate and
						trust work.
