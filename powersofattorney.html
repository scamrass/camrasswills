					<h3>Lasting Powers of Attorney</h3>
					<p>Do you know what happens if you or your loved ones lose
						the capacity to make decisions?</p>
					<p>
						<a id="downloadGuide">Click here to download my Guide to
							Lasting Powers of Attorney</a><br />
						<a id="downloadHeatherBatemanStory">Click here to read
							Heather Bateman's story</a>
					</p>
					<p> If you do not have an LPA in place and you lose mental
						capacity, the Court of Protection (CoP) may appoint a
						"Deputy" to make ongoing decisions on your behalf.
						Applying to be a Deputy can be expensive and lengthy.
						Court costs include an application fee of &pound;371,
						a hearing fee of &pound;494 (not always required) and a
						supervision fee and insurance of up to &pound;800 per
						annum. Solicitors" fees for the
						necessary CoP applications can run into thousands of
						pounds. It can take many months before a Deputyship
						order is made and in the interim your financial affairs
						would effectively be frozen - a particular problem if
						care home fees are being funded privately - and all
						welfare decisions would rest with your medical team and
						or social services.
					</p>
					<p>
						The CoP will only appoint one Deputy, who may not be the
						individual you would have chosen. MORE than 99% of
						people could find their wishes descend into financial
						dispute by not appointing power of attorney. Despite
						Lasting Powers of Attorney regulations being introduced
						in 2007, only 135,000 (2011 data) have been registered -
						less than 1% of the population. Dementia affects about
						1% of people aged 60-64 years and as many as 30-50% of
						people older than 85 years. It is the leading reason for
						placing elderly people in institutions such as nursing
						homes. For peace of mind it is important that you make a
						Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to nominate someone you
						trust now to make important decisions on your behalf in
						the future. LPAs are often left too late and you cannot
						make an LPA if you are no longer able to make decisions
						for yourself. </p>
					<p>
						Did you know that even a joint building society or bank
						account may be frozen if one of the account holders
						lacks mental capacity and
						there is no LPA in place. As well as replacing the
						Enduring Powers of Attorney (EPA) use as a document to
						protect your PROPERTY & FINANCIAL AFFAIRS, the
						introduction of the Lasting Power of Attorney also meant
						the introduction of a SECOND document allowing you to
						specify somebody to look after your HEALTH & WELFARE.
					</p>
					<p>
						EPAs can still be used but it is advisable to set up an
						LPA Health & Welfare to run alongside.
						These TWO NEW documents are :-</p>
					<p>
						"The Lasting Power of Attorney - Property & Financial
						Affairs" ("LPA-PA") - this allows you to appoint
						somebody to look after YOUR
						MONEY and related affairs.</p>
					<p>"The Lasting Power of Attorney - Health & Welfare"
						("LPA-HW") - this allows you to appoint somebody to look
						after your personal welfare an healthcare. To a large
						extent this replaces what was commonly known as the
						"Living Will".</p>
